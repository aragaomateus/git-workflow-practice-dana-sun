The article that I find interesting is titled [DeepMind has made software writing AI that rivals average human coder](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2306820-deepmind-has-made-software-writing-ai-that-rivals-average-human-coder/).

## Why I find this article interesting

The way that it was determined that these machines write code better than some humans was that it performed better than the average human programmer when judged in competition. This is the first time an AI code-writing system competed at this level of performance in contest. I think this is really impressive because if computers are growing more and more capable of coding at the level of a standard human, I wonder if this would affect the job industry just yet, and just how expensive this technology is. I also wonder how far it's going to improve, if even. It's a very big step for the world of AI.
