[DeepMind has made software writing AI that rivals average human coder](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2306820-deepmind-has-made-software-writing-ai-that-rivals-average-human-coder/)

## Why I find this article interesting

These machines were determined to be able to write code better than some humans when they performed better than the average human programmer when judged in competition. This is the first time an AI code-writing system competed at this level of performance in contest, which I think this is really impressive. If computers are growing more and more capable of coding at the level of a standard human, I wonder if this would affect the job industry just yet, and just how expensive this technology is. I also wonder how far it's going to improve, if even. It's a very big step for the world of AI and it could open further doors to the future of technology.

It's definitely impressive and jarring to see that AI has been developed to before better than the average programmer. However, I think there are still several advantages of having a human be a programmer. In scrum teams, for example, being able to collaborate with others is definitely an advantage and arguably increases the efficiency of development more so than an automated AI programmer.
